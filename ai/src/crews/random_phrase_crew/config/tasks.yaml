    as possible while maintaining natural flow and meaning. Consider the user context
    to make the phrase more relevant and personalized. It's acceptable to skip
    words that don't fit naturally. Prioritize creating something that sounds authentic
    and meaningful rather than forcing all words together awkwardly.

    itself, with no additional explanation or commentary.
